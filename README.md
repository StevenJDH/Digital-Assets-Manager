# Digital Assets Manager
Monitors your cryptocurrency profits without needing to access your accounts or deal with watch only wallets that may pose a privacy risk. This is also useful for those who are using hardware wallets.

## Application is still in alpha stages with a temporary interface.
A lot of things still need to change and improve as I get a better ideas of what I want to do with this applicaiton and how much time I have to work on it.

## Support
Inital support was based on exchanges that I used as this was a personal project, so for now, this works more accurately for people using Kraken and Bittrex. Once I make a clean method to include various ticker APIs from other exchanges, I will add additional support.

## TO DO
Way to much to even begin to list. Check back in a few months.
