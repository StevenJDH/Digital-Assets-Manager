## Application is still in alpha stages with a temporary interface.
A lot of things still need to change and improve as I get a better idea of what I want to do with this application and how much time I have to work on it.

## Features
* Profit and investment monitoring.
* Altcoin & Fiat (Euro) manager
* Live rate updates from Kraken and Bittrex
* Database backup and restore features
* Altcoin rate summary
* Initial support for auto rate refreshing
* High DPI support for up to 300%

## Future Features
* Block confirmation checking for multiple altcoin.
* Possible price alerts.
* Profit calculator for traders.
* More fiat support.

## Compatibility
Initial support was based on exchanges that I used as this was a personal project, so for now, this works more accurately for people using Kraken and Bittrex. Anyone can use this program if they don't mind the small rate differences between exchanges. As I continue to develop a clean method to include various APIs from other exchanges, I will add additional support.

## TODO
Way too much to even begin to list. Check back in a few months as a lot of the work is being done under the hood.
