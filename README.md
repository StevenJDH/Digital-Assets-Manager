## Application is still in alpha stages with a temporary interface.
A lot of things still need to change and improve as I get a better ideas of what I want to do with this application and how much time I have to work on it.

## Features
* Profit and investment monitoring.
* Altcoin & Fiat (Euro) manager
* Live rate updates from Kraken and Bittrex
* Database backup and restore features
* Altcoin rate summary

## Future Features
* Block confirmation checking for multiple altcoin.
* Auto refresh rates and possible price alerts.
* Profit calculator for traders.
* More fiat support.

## Compatibility
Initial support was based on exchanges that I used as this was a personal project, so for now, this works more accurately for people using Kraken and Bittrex. Anyone can use this program if they don't mind the small rate differences between exchanges. As I continue to develop a clean method to include various APIs from other exchanges, I will add additional support.

## TODO
Way too much to even begin to list. Check back in a few months as a lot of the work is being done under the hood.

## Why am I contributing?
This is just one of many tools and applications Iâ€™ve created over the years for myself that I thought I should share with the public. I am new to GitHub so bear with me while I get adjusted. Hopefully, with community support, some of these applications will grow into something better.
